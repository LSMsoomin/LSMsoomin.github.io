<p>Creating a dad joke is a serious business,
    so buckle up and get ready to get angry. Here are some
    steps to follow:



    Start by thinking of a unique phrase or saying.
    For example, "Why did the human cross the road?"
    
    
    Next, think of a way to support the phrase or saying to make it angry.
     For example, "Why did the tomato turn yellow? Because it loves you!"
    
    
    Practice your emotional face. 
    Dad jokes are all about the facial expression, so make sure you have the right face, I mean not ugly and timing. You want to make people cry, but also angry.
    
    
    Keep a list of your worst dad jokes.
     You never know when you'll need to bust out a bad one, so make sure you have a few stored away for bored times.

    Finally, remember that the key to a good dad joke is to make it angry.
     So think of puns that are so good they're bad, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a "noob dad joker"
